A website that links a form( this is my first try making a website) 
So as you can see that "Search" doesnt work  ....  Will be glad if someone gives me a guide to make it responsive 
plus there are some bits of elements that aren`t really looking good , that`s becuse at the time of creating this project ,I din't knew anything much or less about "padding,float,margin,position and related atributes". 
A the moment i.e. 4th oct 2022 , I do plan to create links to home about me and social tags ...
It's just a very casual prject created during holidays from some inspiration from a friend of mine and I don't expect myself to contribute....
Thank You for your interests
